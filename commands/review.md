# /review

Review the current diff or a specific PR.

## Usage
```
/review                    # review staged + unstaged changes
/review --staged           # review only staged changes
/review <PR number>        # review a GitHub PR by number
/review ultra              # deep multi-agent review (billed, uses cloud)
/review ultra <PR number>  # deep multi-agent review of a specific PR
```

## What this does

Invokes the `code-review` skill on the specified scope.

For `/review` and `/review --staged`: reads `git diff` and applies the review checklist (correctness, security, contracts, error handling, new packages).

For `/review <PR number>`: fetches the PR diff via `gh pr diff <number>` and reviews it.

For `/review ultra`: delegates to a `reviewer` subagent for deep, independent analysis free of implementation bias.

## Output
